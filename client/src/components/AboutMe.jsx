        <p>
          Hi, I’m Jon—a <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> passionate about solving complex problems and building impactful applications. I thrive at the intersection of <strong>technology, creativity, and problem-solving</strong>, bringing a <strong>relentless drive for learning</strong> and a <strong>knack for tackling tough challenges</strong> head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before diving into software development, I spent <strong>four years as a project manager overseeing eddy current inspections at nuclear power plants</strong>—an environment where precision, adaptability, and fast problem-solving were critical. Each project required me to quickly learn new systems, lead teams under pressure, and engineer efficient solutions. These experiences directly translate into my approach to building scalable, robust software.
        </p>
        <p>
          My transition into tech was driven by an <strong>unshakable passion for coding and continuous learning</strong>. I completed an intensive <strong>software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, REST API design, authentication, and database management. Since then, I’ve expanded my expertise by diving into CI/CD, cloud deployments, and scalable architecture while refining my skills in <strong>Python, Flask, React, Redux, SQL, and AWS S3</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my <strong>proudest projects</strong> is the <strong>Fantasy Football Research Hub (FFRH)</strong>—a community-driven fantasy football platform where users create rankings, submit reviews, and analyze player data. Built with <strong>React, Flask, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3</strong>, FFRH showcases my ability to design scalable systems, optimize database queries, and build seamless user experiences. I also developed an Event Manager app and my personal portfolio website, further honing my skills in both frontend and backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m currently <strong>seeking a software engineering role</strong> where I can contribute my technical expertise, problem-solving mindset, and adaptability to real-world challenges. I’m eager to expand my skill set into <strong>TypeScript, Docker, and DevOps tools</strong> and join a team that values <strong>innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning</strong>. I thrive in environments where <strong>curiosity, teamwork, and problem-solving drive meaningful progress</strong>, and I’m excited to grow alongside talented engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than just writing code, I want to build products that matter, <strong>contribute to impactful projects, and continuously push myself to improve</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I’m passionate about <strong>sports, video games, fitness, hiking, and attending concerts</strong>. I enjoy working with people who are driven, curious, and excited about technology—so if that sounds like you, let’s connect!

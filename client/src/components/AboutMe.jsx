        Hi, my name is Jon, I'm a passionate fullstack developer with experience in building dynamic web applications.
        I’m a software engineer with a knack for tackling complex challenges and a passion for continuous learning.

        While deepening my knowledge of coding, I spent four years as a project manager overseeing eddy current inspections for nuclear power plants—work that required precision, 
        resilience, and problem-solving under pressure. Before I started my nuclear career I also spent some time working as a waiter, where I honed my teamwork skills and
        learned the value of delivering high-quality service. These experiences gave me a strong foundation in both leadership and adaptability, which I now leverage
        in my tech career. After working in Nuclear, I decided to move on from that career to fully invest and commit to my passion for technology and software development.

        With expertise in full-stack development, deployment, Python, Flask, React, Vite, SQL, and version control, I am well-prepared to contribute to dynamic and innovative teams.
        My goal is to create intuitive, engaging, and impactful user experiences.
        My recent journey through a rigorous software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School has only deepened my excitement for technology and my drive to continually expand my skills.
        </p>

        Outside of work, I’m passionate about sports, video games, fitness, and outdoor activities like hiking. Whether I'm gaming with friends, attending concerts, or working out, 
        I always bring a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm to everything I do. I’m also a lifelong learner who enjoys reading about new technologies and exploring the latest trends 
        in software engineering.

        I look forward to connecting with people who share my passion for technology and innovation. If you're seeking a dedicated, adaptable, and growth-oriented engineer,
        I’d love to talk about how we could work together.
